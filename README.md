### Project Description
We are exploring LinkedIn job posting descriptions and analyzing what are key
qualitative factors that differentiate postings with a higher quantity of applications from a
lower quantity. We hypothesize that job postings that have a higher number of applicants
will be more detailed in summary and more descriptive in adjectives. We will be using
three different methods of keyword extraction as our text analysis.
