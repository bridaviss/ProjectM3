### Project Description
This project aims to explore the impact of the FIFA World Cup from 1994-2022 on commomidity prices of barley, corn, and cotton. These commomidities, which are used to make beer, snacks/food, and clothing, are central to the fanfare that is integral to the World Cup. Conducting a time-series analysis, we will using ARIMA models, VAR models, and t-tests specifically to capture temporal dynamics and identify the impact and relationships of the FIFA World Cup on commomidity prices. 

### What you will find in this repo: 
Each section header will direct you to the respective folder.
1. A section containg our source code and how to use and install it: SRC. 
2. A section containing our source data: DATA.
3. A section containing key figures from our analysis: FIGURES.
4. A reference section containing all acknolwedgments and references.

## [SRC Section](https://github.com/bridaviss/ProjectM3/tree/main/SRC):

### Installing/Building Our Code:
The three documents within this section contains the entire source code for our project and analysis for [Barley](https://github.com/bridaviss/ProjectM3/blob/main/SRC/BarleyAnalysis.R), [Corn](), and [Cotton](). Within it, it contains our data cleaning and our analyses for these three commodities. 

### Usuage of Our Code:
The goal of this analysis was to examine the impact of the FIFA World Cup on the commommodity prices of barley, corn, and cotton. 
   - To do this, we did three types of analysis:
      1. ARIMA Models
      2. VAR Models
      3. T-tests

### This is still a work in progress.

### Table of Contents:
   1. ["PricesOverTime.png"](https://github.com/bridaviss/ProjectM3/blob/main/FIGURES/PricesOverTime.png): This graphic looks at the commodity prices of barley, corn, and cotton over time with the occurence of the FIFA World Cup highlighted in red.
      - Key Takeaways: At first glance, it does not seem that the FIFA World Cup is having a massive impact on the prices of these three commidities. Throughout time, the prices are similar, but the reason for this does not seem to be the World Cup.
     
   2. ["CorrelationPrice.png"](https://github.com/bridaviss/ProjectM3/blob/main/FIGURES/CorrelationPrice.png): This graphic looks at the correlation between commodity prices between 1990-2023.
      - Key Takeaways: There seems to be a positive correlation between these three commodiities, but it does not look like the FIFA World Cup is an impact that is driving this correlation or the direction of prices.
