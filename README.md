### Project Description
This project aims to explore the impact of the FIFA World Cup from 1994-2022 on commomidity prices of barley, corn, and cotton. These commomidities, which are used to make beer, snacks/food, and clothing, are central to the fanfare that is integral to the World Cup. Conducting a time-series analysis, we will using ARIMA models, VAR models, and t-tests specifically to capture temporal dynamics and identify the impact and relationships of the FIFA World Cup on commomidity prices.

### Installing/Building Our Code:
The "World Cup Analysis.R" document contains the entire source code for our project and analysis. Within it, it contains our data cleaning and our different types of analysis. 


### Usuage of Our Code:
The goal of this analysis was to examine the impact of the FIFA World Cup on the commommodity prices of barley, corn, and cotton. 
   - To do this, we did three types of analysis:
      1. ARIMA Models
      2. VAR Models
      3. T-tests
